abstract = "This paper investigates a method for finding a neuro-fuzzy based solution to the inverse kinematics problem of robotic manipulators. For this purpose, the case of a hypothetical 3 degree of freedom (DOF) planar robot is considered, for which computer simulation is performed in order to outline the effectiveness of the approach. By transforming the inverse kinematics problem to a fitting problem, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is trained using the inverse mapping of the data provided by the forward kinematics and learns, with acceptable accuracy, the end-effecter's localization to joint angles mapping."

abstract = "Planar two and three-link manipulators are often used in Robotics as testbeds for various algorithms or theories. In this paper, the case of a three-link planar manipulator is considered. For this type of robot a solution to the inverse kinematics problem, needed for generating desired trajectories in the Cartesian space (2D) is found by using a feed-forward neural network."
