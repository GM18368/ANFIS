abstract = "This paper investigates a method for finding a neuro-fuzzy based solution to the inverse kinematics problem of robotic manipulators. For this purpose, the case of a hypothetical 3 degree of freedom (DOF) planar robot is considered, for which computer simulation is performed in order to outline the effectiveness of the approach. By transforming the inverse kinematics problem to a fitting problem, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is trained using the inverse mapping of the data provided by the forward kinematics and learns, with acceptable accuracy, the end-effecter's localization to joint angles mapping."

For this type of robot a solution to the inverse kinematics problem, needed for generating desired trajectories in the Cartesian space (2D) is found by using a feed-forward neural network."

abstract = "Kinematic redundancy occurs when a manipulator possesses more degrees of freedom than those required to execute a given task. Several kinematic techniques for redundant manipulators control the gripper through the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian, but lead to a kind of chaotic inner motion with unpredictable arm configurations. Such algorithms are not easy to adapt to optimization schemes and, moreover, often there are multiple optimization objectives that can conflict between them. Unlike single optimization, where one attempts to find the best solution, in multi-objective optimization there is no single solution that is optimum with respect to all indices. Therefore, trajectory planning of redundant robots remains an important area of research and more efficient optimization algorithms are needed. This paper presents a new technique to solve the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. This scheme combines the closed-loop pseudo-inverse method with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to control the joint positions. Simulations for manipulators with three or four rotational joints, considering the optimization of two objectives in a workspace without and with obstacles are developed. The results reveal that it is possible to choose several solutions from the Pareto optimal front according to the importance of each individual objective."

abstract = "In this paper, a dual neural network, LVI (linear variational inequalities)-based primal-dual neural network and simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network are presented for online repetitive motion planning (RMP) of redundant robot manipulators (with a four-link planar manipulator as an example). To do this, a drift-free criterion is exploited in the form of a quadratic performance index. In addition, the repetitive-motion-planning scheme could incorporate the joint physical limits such as joint limits and joint velocity limits simultaneously. Such a scheme is finally reformulated as a quadratic program (QP). As QP real-time solvers, the aforementioned three kinds of neural networks all have piecewise-linear dynamics and could globally exponentially converge to the optimal solution of strictly-convex quadratic-programs. Furthermore, the neural-network based RMP scheme is simulated based on a four-link planar robot manipulator. Computer-simulation results substantiate the theoretical analysis and also show the effective remedy of the joint angle drift problem of robot manipulators."

abstract = "The management of concrete quality is an important task of concrete industry. This paper researched on the structured and unstructured factors which affect the concrete quality. Compressive strength of concrete is one of the most essential qualities of concrete, conventional regression models to predict the concrete strength could not achieve an expected result due to the unstructured factors. For this reason, two hybrid models were proposed in this paper, one was the genetic based algorithm the other was the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). For the genetic based algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize the weights and thresholds of back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). For the ANFIS model, two building methods were explored. By adopting these predicting methods, considerable cost and time-consuming laboratory tests could be saved. The result showed that both of these two hybrid models have good performance in desirable accuracy and applicability in practical production, endowing them high potential to substitute the conventional regression models in real engineering practice."

abstract = "Optimization of a multiple output system, whose function is only approximately known and is represented in tabular form, is modeled and optimized by the combined use of a neuro-fuzzy network and optimization techniques which do not require the explicit representation of the function. Neuro-fuzzy network is useful for learning the approximate original tabular system. However, the results obtained by the neuro-fuzzy network are represented implicitly in the network. The MANFIS neuro-fuzzy network, which is an extension of the ANFIS network, is used to model the multiple output system and a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the resulting multiple objective decision making problem. A chemical process whose function is represented approximately in tabular form is solved to illustrate the approach."
